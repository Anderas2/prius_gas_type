    "At the gas station, i have the habit switch between SP98 and E10. E10 is sold around 10 cents less expensive, however, the car consumes more of it per 100km. E10 contains 10% alcohol and is otherwise \"super\" fuel, sold as \"95\" in some countries. SP98 is the fuel sold as \"super plus\" or \"super 98\".\n",

    "This consumption difference between two fuels is difficult to find because my car uses more or less gas depending on the weather, the traffic conditions, my personal mood, the speed, and the length of the route. For this first try, i did not connect to the CAN bus, so i had no information about the motor temperature and only one measurement per ride, taken by hand. As if it was not difficult enough, the Prius needs only one refill per month, so the season was changing while i did the recording.\n",
